  <center><h1>Don't Drink and Drive</h1></center><br>
  <p>
  <h3>
  Drinking and driving is a huge issue today. Many deaths are caused by negligent drivers under the influence of alcohol or another substance.
  In 2015, more than 10,000 people died as a result of impaired driving, and more than a million reports of driving under the influence. It is also estimated that there are more than a hundred million drunk driving occurrences
    per year. All studies are done by the CDC.

  <h3>
    One third of drunk drivers are repeat offenders as well, and some have suspended licenses as well. Illegal driving massively increases risk of crashes. 
  In order to ensure the safety of drivers, it is necessary for drivers to be sober, but currently too many drivers are under the influence when on the road.
